# Alien invasion game

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

----------
### First Requirement
For the first development phase, we’ll make a ship that can move right
and left when the player presses the arrow keys and fire bullets when the
player presses the spacebar. After setting up this behavior, we can create the
aliens and refine the gameplay.
